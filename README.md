- 👋 Hi, I’m Simon (@SiWickham). I'm a data analyst with a focus on healthcare transformation. I have worked as an analyst in the NHS since 2018 across providers and NHS specific consultancy, committed to utilising health care data to drive positive change across all aspects of the NHS, from small single site services to national programmes of work. Equipped with a diverse toolkit including R Studio, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, I excel in developing comprehensive deliverables that drive actionable insights and are suitable to the users needs and skills.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating predictive models, from estimating estates spend to planning future demand and capacity. I have a history in Quality Improvement analysis and I enjoy looking for opportunities to apply that knowledge in new situations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use R and RStudio, as well as Git. Having previous experience with coding languages like SQL, it has been interesting to learn how a new language works in comparison and how base R varies from other packages like tidyr.
- 💞️ Recently I have modelled activity and capacity data for constructing new Endoscopy Hubs and developed an estates baseline as part of the infrastructure strategy for an Integrated Care System, including long-term cost projections over a ten-year horizon.
