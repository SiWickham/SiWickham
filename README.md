Hi! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile.

# 👨‍🦱 About me (He/Him)
I'm an experienced NHS analyst with over 6 years experience of working across acute and commissioning bodies across the health and care sector. I am passionate about leveraging public health and provider data to improve decision-making across healthcare. I have a masters degree in Physics and relish a rich data source to interrogate. I currently work for the NHS Transformation Unit working on a variety of projects from modelling demand and capacity to developing comprehensive baselines of populations or systems to developing dashboards for organisation or system oversight. Take a look at our GitHub page to learn more.

# 🔨 What I'm working on
Estates Infrastructure: Using Power BI to undertake analysis on a range of estates related data, to inform current building backlog costs and predict future estates spend. I don't often use Power BI but find it a useful tool that organisations are familiar with, which aids engagement.
Service Demand Baseline: Creating reports in RMarkdown to provide a system and provider view of what the current demand is in ED for Mental Health related attendances. This has been my first project report using R and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It has been a steep learning curve but has made organising an interactive report easier and with finer controls of the visuals. I have particularly enjoyed playing with the different visuals on offer in ggplot2.
Dashboard and Report Creation: Creating dashboards in Tableau to allow users to get a quick glance at what is happening within their system. An example can be seen on the Transformation Unit [website](https://transformationunit.nhs.uk/population-health-dashboard/) 

# 🌱 What I'm currently learning
R and RStudio: Having previous experience with coding languages, e.g. SQL, it has been interesting to learn how a new language works in comparison and how base R varies from other packages like tidyr. I have started exploring different visuals and functions to develop RMarkdown reports as part of my portfolio.
